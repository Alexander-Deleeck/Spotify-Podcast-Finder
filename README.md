# Spotify-Podcast-Finder
This program aims to resolve an inconvenience I frequently experience on the Spotify platform; I am a fan of certain researchers (such as Michael Levin) and enjoy listening to podcast episodes on which they appear as a guest. Spotify unfortunately does not offer sorting podcast episode search results by recency, making it hard to find new episodes.
